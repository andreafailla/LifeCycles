``lifecycles`` is a Python package designed to support the temporal analysis of groups of items.
The analysis of such entities – be they graph nodes, records in a dataset, or any other kind of data point,  –
as well as of the groups they form, is fundamental in a wide range of fields,
including social network analysis, epidemiology, and business intelligence.

``lifecycles`` provides a set of tools to model and analyze the evolution of these clusters in

Goals
-----

``lifecycles`` aims to provide:

- a simple framework to model clusters of entities and their evolution over time at scale;
- measures to quantify the evolution according to informative dimensions;
- tools to investigate the relationship between the evolution of clusters and individual entities' metadata;
- visual analytics facilities to summarize analytical results.

Future releases will include enhanced support statistical analysis to assess the significance of the observed patterns,
and to support the development of predictive models.
